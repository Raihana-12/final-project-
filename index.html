            <p> Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, has a rich and ancient history. It is believed to be over 3,500 years old and was mentioned during the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Located at a strategic crossroads in Asia, Kabul was a key destination on the ancient Silk Road2. Over the centuries, it has been ruled by various dynasties and empires, including the Seleucids, Mauryans, Kushans, Mongols, and the Mughal Empire. In the 16th century, the Mughals used Kabul as a summer capital, during which time it prospered2. Today, Kabul remains Afghanistan's political, cultural, and economic center</p>

                <p> Bagh-e Babur (Dari: باغ بابر), also known as Gardens of Babur, is a historic site in Chelsatun, Kabul, Afghanistan. It is located in the Sher Darwaza hillside of District 5, southwest of Shahr-e Naw, or a short distance south of Kabul Zoo and north of Chihil Sutun.The gardens of Babur has several terraced buildings, a small mosque, and plenty of walking space. Visited by up to one million locals and foreign tourists a year,it is also where the tomb of the first Mughal emperor Babur is located. The park is thought to have been developed around 1504,[2] when Babur gave orders for the construction of an "avenue garden" in Kabul, described in some detail in his memoirs, the Baburnama. It has been re-developed by various Afghan rulers since then.</p>

                font-size: x-large;"> Darul Aman Palace</h4>
                <p> Darul Aman Palace (Dari: قصر دارالامان; 'Abode of Peace' or, in a double meaning, 'Abode of Amanullah') is a three-story palace located in Darulaman locality, about 16 km (9.9 miles) south-west of the center of Kabul, Afghanistan. Surrounding the palace are the following buildings: the National Assembly, the National Museum of Afghanistan and the Afghan International University.

                    The 150-room Darul Aman Palace was originally built in the 1920s, during the reign of Amanullah Khan. He reigned as Emir of Afghanistan between February 1919 and June 1926, and as King of Afghanistan between June 1926 and January 1929. The palace was severely damaged during the 1990s civil war. However, between 2016 and 2020, the palace was renovated and restored to its former glory. Most work was completed for the 100th anniversary of Afghan independence, which was on 19 August 2019.The site is open to the public and tourists.</p>

                font-size: x-large;"> National Museum of Afghanistan</h4>
                <p>The National Museum of Afghanistan(Dari:موزیم افغانستان) is located across the street from the Darul Aman Palace in the Darulaman area of Kabul, Afghanistan. It was once considered to be one of the world's finest museums.There have been reports about expanding the museum or building a new larger one. Mohammad Zubair Abedi serves as the current director of the museum.

                    The museum's collection had earlier been one of the most important in Central Asia,with over 100,000 items dating back several millennia, including items from Persian, Buddhist, and Islamic dynasties.
                    
                    With the start of the civil war in 1992, the museum was looted numerous times and destroyed by rockets, resulting in a loss of 70% of the 100,000 objects on display.
                    
                    Since 2007, a number of international organizations have helped to recover over 8,000 artifacts, the most recent being a limestone sculpture from Germany.
                    
                    Approximately 843 artifacts were returned by the United Kingdom in 2012, including the famous 1st Century Begram ivories. </p>
